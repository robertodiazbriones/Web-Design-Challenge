# Web-Design-Challenge

Web Design Challenge homework corresponds to the 11th unit of the **Data Analisis bootcamp course**, on this assign we have to create a visualization dashboard website showing off the analysis we have done, specifically we'll be plotting weather data.

## What I learnt

With this unit we finished the first half of the course, as we advance we can see/practice how all what we have learnt is used and work together to a real day to date porpuse, as in the SQL homework assembly building queries is the backbone of getting the correct data and find what we are looking for.
